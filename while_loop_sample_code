# NOTE: The term "defining" should be saved for defining a function; use "creating" in regards to variables.
# Start with CREATING the requested variable and then assigning the starting value to it.

candy_purchased = 0

# Once the variable is defined, next create the while loop as an iterative statement.
# For the While statement, decide which logical operator is needed (+,-,/,%,*,<,>,>=,<=,+=,-=).
# The logical operator will need to be specified along with the end value needed to resolve the loop.
# Specify the number of iterations needed until the loop is resolved; usually it is the end value but not always.
# Start with creating the while statement and the relation to the variable.
# Then indent in the next line to define the print function.
# In the Print statement, consider what should be shown as a descriptor,
# then the logical operator that joins the variable to the descriptor, and specify the type of the variable (str, int, float),
# then cap off the line with two parentheses to end the print statement.

while candy_purchased <= 5:
print('Candy purchased: ' + str(candy_purchased))

# Now, specify the increments for the candy_purchased counter, using the appropriate logical operator for the loop.
candy_purchased += 1
print("You have enough candy. For now...")
